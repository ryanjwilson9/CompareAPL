  "title": "Comprehensive Difference Matrix — APL 25-005 (Feb 12 2025) vs. APL 21-004 (May 3 2022)",
  "summary": "APL 25-005 retains strong nondiscrimination, threshold language, and language assistance protections from APL 21-004 but introduces new operational duties, federal updates, tighter timelines, and expanded accessibility and reporting. Notable changes align with the 2024 Section 1557 Final Rule, reshaping documentation, data sharing, grievance management, and enforcement. Definitions, roles, and procedures for providing language and disability access are clarified or expanded, and compliance/corrective action standards are reinforced.",

  "conclusion": "APL 25-005 represents a substantive compliance, operational, and enforcement shift for MCPs. Adopting 2024 federal requirements, it increases the frequency and specificity of outreach, documentation, reporting, and grievance response related to language access and nondiscrimination. Tier 1 changes require significant process overhaul—including annual notices, complex record retention, multi-entity data sharing, and stricter timelines—while Tier 2 changes expand scope, accountability, and contractor/subcontractor responsibilities. Tier 3 changes, though lower impact, standardize formatting and remove outdated federal references. Plans should promptly adjust workflows, policies, and communication channels to avoid sanctions and ensure compliance by the August 2025 deadline."
