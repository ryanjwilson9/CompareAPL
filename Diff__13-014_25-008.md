# Consolidated Key Changes: **APL 25‑008 (May 5 2025)** vs. **APL 13‑014 (Oct 28 2013)**

**APL 25‑008 keeps the core hospice‑benefit rules from APL 13‑014 but layers on top a tighter set of compliance, documentation, and payment requirements.**  
The main additions you’ll need to bake into plan policies are below—each bullet highlights what is *new or materially expanded* in the 2025 letter.

---

## 1. Faster, paper‑trail‑driven eligibility & revocation
- **Election notice & liability** – Hospice must file the DHCS *Medi‑Cal Hospice Program Election Notice* with the MCP **within 5 calendar days**; late submission makes the hospice financially liable for days before submission.  
- **Revocation form deadline** – A member‑signed revocation statement must reach the MCP **within 5 days**; late or missing forms shift financial risk to the hospice.  
- **Certification of Terminal Illness clarified** – Details who signs the initial (medical director **and** attending physician) and subsequent benefit‑period certifications, reaffirming the six‑month prognosis requirement.  

## 2. Out‑of‑network hospice & continuity‑of‑care
- MCPs may restrict payment to in‑network hospices *unless* services are unavailable; when members choose an out‑of‑network provider, plans must issue single‑case/LOA contracts, verify licensing/Medicare certification/NPI, and honor continuity‑of‑care protections if the member is already on service.  

## 3. Face‑to‑face encounter rule
- Beginning with the **third benefit period (and every period thereafter)**, a hospice MD/NP must perform—and attest to—an in‑person exam ≤ 30 days before the period starts (or ≤ 2 days after a late admission).  

## 4. More granular payment & rate logic
- **National revenue codes** (0552, 0650, 0652, 0655, 0656, 0657, 0659) replace legacy Z‑codes; adds *high* (days 1‑60) vs. *low* (day 61+) routine‑home‑care rates, an automatic 60‑day reset, and a **service‑intensity add‑on** for the last 7 days of life.  
- **Physician visits** now bill under **Rev. 0657**; code **Z7108** is retired.  
- **Medicare‑parity rate floor** – MCPs must pay at least the Medicare hospice rate and update rates annually.  
- **Dually eligible SNF residents** – The MCP pays room & board **directly to the hospice** and may not require a Medicare EOB/RA with the claim.  

## 5. Fraud, Waste & Abuse (FWA) controls
- New **Section VI** mandates member‑level integrity flags, encounter‑data completeness checks, and pre‑/post‑payment documentation reviews; DHCS can impose corrective‑action plans (CAPs) and monetary sanctions for non‑compliance.  

## 6. Children / CCS integration & palliative‑care linkage
- Updates references to **EPSDT, CCS NL 12‑1119, Whole Child Model APL 24‑015**, and ACA § 2302 concurrent‑care rights.  
- Clarifies that *“palliative items or services”* under hospice are distinct from the Medi‑Cal Palliative Care program (APL 18‑020).  

## 7. Provider‑plan administrative duties
- MCPs must submit updated policies & procedures *or* a “no‑change” attestation through the MCOD Submission Portal **within 90 days** and cascade requirements to subcontractors; failure may trigger CAPs or fines.  

## 8. Benefit‑period restatement
- Re‑states the Medicare hospice benefit sequence—**90 + 90 + unlimited 60‑day periods**—up front so plans and providers calculate coverage windows uniformly.  

## 9. Documentation‑driven utilisation review
- No prior authorization for home‑care levels, but MCPs may **deny, down‑code, or recoup payment** if documentation doesn’t support the billed level; financial liability for unsupported days rests with the hospice provider.

### In short
**APL 25‑008 retains the substantive hospice benefit but converts what were largely policy descriptions in 2013 into enforceable process steps, documentation deadlines, revenue‑code logic, and FWA safeguards.**  
Plans must update internal workflows, provider manuals, and claims‑edit rules accordingly.
