  "title": "Comprehensive Difference Matrix — APL 25‑008 (May 5 2025) vs. APL 13‑014 (Oct 28 2013)",
  "summary": "APL 25‑008 preserves the core hospice‑benefit structure set out in APL 13‑014 but adds a much tighter layer of compliance, documentation, payment and program‑integrity requirements. The matrix below groups the changes into **Additions** (entirely new in 2025), **Updates** (2013 language materially rewritten or expanded) and **Redactions** (requirements present in 2013 that disappear in 2025). Each entry keeps the full descriptive text so it can drop straight into a table or migration checklist.",
  "categories": {
    "Additions": [
      {
        "bullet": "**Election notice & liability** – Hospice providers must transmit the DHCS *Medi‑Cal Hospice Program Election Notice* (and any required addendum) to the member’s managed care plan **within five calendar days of certification/election**; if that deadline is missed, the hospice—not the plan—bears financial responsibility for any services rendered before the form is accepted.",

      {
        "bullet": "**Revocation form deadline** – When a member revokes hospice, the provider must submit the member‑signed revocation statement to the plan **within five calendar days**. Failure to do so places the cost of any days after the effective date of revocation on the hospice provider.",

        "bullet": "**Out‑of‑network hospice & continuity‑of‑care safeguards** – Managed care plans may restrict payment to in‑network hospices, **unless services are unavailable**. When a member elects an out‑of‑network provider, the plan must establish a single‑case or letter‑of‑agreement contract, verify Medicare certification, California Department of Public Health license and NPI, and honor continuity‑of‑care rights if the patient was already on service prior to enrollment.",

Plans need to update internal workflows, provider manuals and claims‑edit rules accordingly.",
